# Solving the CartPole balancing game

The idea of CartPole is that there is a pole standing up on top of a cart. The goal is to balance this pole by moving the cart from side to side to keep the pole balanced upright.

The environment is deemed successful if we can balance for 500 frames, and failure is deemed when the pole is more than 15 degrees from fully vertical or the cart moves more than 2.4 units from the center.

Every frame that we go with the pole "balanced" (less than 15 degrees from vertical), our "score" gets +1, and our target is a score of 500.

Now, how do we do this? There are endless ways, some very complex, and some very specific. I chose to demonstrate how deep reinforcement learning (deep Q-learning) can be implemented and applied to play a CartPole game using Keras and Gym. I will try to explain everything without requiring any prerequisite knowledge about reinforcement learning.

Before starting, take a look at this ![YouTube video](https://youtu.be/XiigTGKZfks) with a real-life demonstration of a cartpole problem learning process. Looks amazing, right? Implementing such a self-learning system is easier than you may think. Letâ€™s dive in!
